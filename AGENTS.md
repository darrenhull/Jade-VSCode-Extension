# Jade VS Code extension engineering and review guidance

## Architecture and responsibilities

This repository owns editor commands, language/UI integration, Testing, views, DAP presentation and its pinned CLI dependency. It adapts the CLI rather than implementing another compiler, broker or object manager.

- Review activation, registration, settings, disposal and reload behavior. Use the bundled CLI and report startup failures; do not silently use legacy backends.
- Preserve individual tests, outcomes, source locations and compiler Problems across cancellation and repeated runs.
- Maintain schema-qualified navigation and target-qualified object identities. Reuse a member tab for its class/object while preserving separately opened contexts.
- Keep large class/object views searchable and paged; avoid blocking the extension host or eagerly rendering entire catalogues.
- Review webview messages, escaping, CSP, keyboard support, accessible labels, loading/empty/error states and stale asynchronous responses.
- Make dirty-editor state, saved-file compilation and reviewed publication snapshots explicit. Do not overwrite unsaved edits or publish different bytes from the reviewed source.
- Keep DAP capabilities honest and preserve supported breakpoints, stack/variables and lifecycle behavior.
- Dependency updates must commit the verified CLI archive and lock together, validate the VSIX and open a PR. Marketplace and Source publication are separate explicit actions.

## Engineering approach

- Understand the change, its callers and its runtime/data boundaries before editing. Inspect implementation and tests; do not infer behavior from names alone.
- Use TDD: add a meaningful failing test, verify the intended failure, implement the smallest correct change, then run relevant regressions. Record red/green evidence in the PR.
- Keep one top-level class per source file, named for that class. Keep executable entry points thin. Cohesive stateless functions are appropriate; avoid artificial classes.
- Store new tests under tests/{Class}/{Class}_{method}_tests.test.js (or .test.ts). Use the module name for functional modules and share realistic fixture setup.
- Apply SOLID at actual boundaries: separate transport, configuration, orchestration, native execution and presentation; inject process/filesystem/network dependencies where tests need control.
- Apply DRY across repositories: the CLI/SDK owns native semantics, shared sessions, dependency selection, release dependency updates and standalone packaging. Consumers use public versioned exports.
- Prefer maintained libraries and official SDKs for established protocols. Keep custom glue small and readable; avoid speculative abstractions and catch-and-ignore fallbacks.
- Run focused tests first, then relevant regression/build/package checks. Default tests must not open a developer's Jade database; connected tests require explicit opt-in, disposable validated fixtures and cleanup of owned resources only.
- Review the final diff for unintended files, secrets, stale comments and behavior changes. Document the final behavior, validation and practical limitations.

## UI evidence

- Every UI change must include a screenshot of the updated, running interface. Capture the actual implementation after the change, not a mockup or an earlier version.
- Visually inspect the screenshot and include it in the PR and the user-facing completion report, with enough context to identify the changed view or control. Cover materially different changed states where one screenshot is insufficient.
- If the UI cannot be run or captured, report the blocker explicitly and leave visual verification outstanding; do not claim it is complete.

## Correctness and compatibility

- Preserve public commands, SDK/event/result contracts, native error codes, cancellation, diagnostics, source locations and individual test outcomes. Incomplete or failed operations must not appear successful.
- Resolve configuration predictably and preserve schema-qualified identities. A same-named class in another schema is a different declaration.
- Preserve native source formats, encoding and meaningful ordering. Avoid broad transformations and invented Jade metadata.
- Build/test against saved local files and their dependencies, including unpublished classes. Establish reusable baselines only after successful native loads and invalidate stale claims after failures or structural changes.
- Handle Windows paths, quoting, case behavior, Unicode, locks and process-exit timing explicitly. Packages must not accidentally depend on a developer checkout, PATH or current directory.

## Security, data and lifecycle

- Keep Source and Working targets distinct. Build/test/debug writes belong in Working; Source publication requires a concrete reviewed plan and authorization.
- Route native work through shared ownership and allowlisted tools. Never expose arbitrary shell/native execution or secret-bearing configuration through an adapter.
- Validate source paths, archive members, arguments, OIDs, cursors and network payloads appropriately. Keep object/cursor identities bound to their database and session.
- Keep secrets out of Git, logs and public artifacts. Restrict private configuration access; preserve it while the native process owns it and clean it up after actual exit.
- Check startup races, cancellation, connection loss, crashes, shutdown and partially completed writes. Settle pending promises, cancel owned work and preserve safe recovery without killing unrelated processes.
- Default to minimal permissions. Verify trusted release origin, version, archive safety, checksums and lockfile integrity before installing or executing an update.

## Performance and operability

- Measure cold and warm paths separately; distinguish database preparation from compilation and execution before claiming improvements.
- Reuse valid native sessions and successful inventories. Avoid repeated full scans, duplicate parsing, per-item process/network calls and unbounded work on hot paths.
- Assume 30,000+ classes: bound concurrency, paginate results, limit retained output and avoid sending full source graphs through UI/transport responses.
- Provide actionable errors and progress, retain the original failure cause, clean up owned resources and make retries safe. Do not hide backend failures with an alternate implementation.

## Builds, releases and maintenance

- Independent checkouts must build from committed inputs and lockfiles. The pinned CLI archive is an intentional consumer build dependency.
- Exclude credentials, user configuration, databases, caches, logs and research notes from Git. Track requested diagrams and build-required source, tests and notices.
- Pin toolchains/dependencies and test the actual portable artifact outside the checkout without Node on PATH.
- Validate PRs without publishing. Tags must match package versions and reference reviewed-default-branch commits. Do not merge PRs or create release tags without authorization.
- Keep README, examples, capabilities and diagrams aligned with implemented behavior. Distinguish hosted CI from connected checks requiring the licensed Jade runtime.

## Code Review Rules

These rules are not exhaustive. Review the complete change and its affected callers for correctness, regressions, security, reliability, maintainability and performance. Do not restrict findings to listed conventions. Prefer concrete, consequential issues with a trigger, impact and location over speculative or style-only findings.

- Trace success, failure, cancellation and repeated operations across boundaries. Check partial failures, races, resource leaks, stale state and recovery.
- Ask whether the tests detect the actual failure, especially where native behavior differs from a mock. Flag misleading green checks and missing meaningful behavioral coverage.
- Check compatibility of the committed CLI archive, consumer lock, native helpers, runtime assumptions and deployed artifacts.
- Check that Source cannot be changed by build/test/read-only inspection and that native ownership and target identity cannot be bypassed or confused.
- Check performance evidence and ensure ordinary navigation, single-file operations and paged lookups do not unexpectedly trigger expensive project-wide work.
- Check release/update automation for unreviewed publication, unverified downloads, stale integrity and silently skipped failures.
